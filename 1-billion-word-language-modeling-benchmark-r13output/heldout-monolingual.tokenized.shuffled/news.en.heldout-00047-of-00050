Sales for the Cobra segment , excluding $ 1.1 million of mobile navigation sales in the prior year , declined by $ 6.2 million , or 26.5 percent , while sales of the PPL segment declined by $ 2.4 million , or 57.1 percent . The most significant decline in Cobra segment sales was for domestic Citizens Band radios , which fell by more than 40 percent , as declining freight movements resulted in reductions in traffic at travel centers and truck stops . Additionally , Cobra experienced a vendor delay that caused more than $ 800,000 of Citizens Band radio sales to shift into the second quarter . Also impacting sales in the first quarter was a decline in domestic two-way radio sales of approximately 40 percent , primarily due to last year 's decision by Wal-Mart to reduce Cobra 's SKU count in this category . As noted in prior releases , Cobra has been awarded exclusive positioning for two-way radios at Wal-Mart in 2009 and substantially improved positioning at Best Buy ; it is anticipated that these sales will become visible in the second quarter as planogram resets are implemented and Cobra is anticipating improved two-way radio sales through the balance of the year .
