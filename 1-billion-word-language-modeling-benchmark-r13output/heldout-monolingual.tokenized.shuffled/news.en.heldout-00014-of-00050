" Each liquidating distribution should be allocated proportionately to each share of stock owned by a shareholder . A shareholder 's gain or loss will be computed on a " per share " basis so that gain or loss is calculated separately for blocks of stock acquired at different dates and different prices . Gain will be recognized in any taxable year in connection with a liquidating distribution only to the extent that the aggregate value of all liquidating distributions received by a shareholder with respect to a share exceeds such shareholder 's tax basis for that share . If the amount of the distributions is less than the shareholder 's basis in his or her shares of common stock , the shareholder will generally recognize a loss only in the year the final distribution is received by the shareholder ( or by a liquidating trust on behalf of the shareholder ) . The Company recommends that shareholders consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to them of the liquidation and dissolution .
